# Last Bastion

At the zenith of the Golden Age, the realms of humanity discovered arcane magic and began to popularize its use on a daily basis. However, the indeliberate use of these energies began to cause strange dimensional portals to appear, tearing at the fabric of reality. Infamous creatures sprang from the portals with the sole intention of devouring and destroying everything in their path. As the years passed, more and more kingdoms fell to the monsters, to the point where the human kingdoms unified into the Ultimate Alliance with the intention of establishing a united front against the monsters ravaging their world, however more defeats brought humanity to the point where they were forced to retreat to the farthest and least prepared of their bastions. However, the flame of hope is still alive, as the Alliance arcanists are on the verge of crafting a powerful artifact that will close the portals and destroy the dimensional beasts. Will the defenders of the Last Stand have enough time to put an end to the extradimensional threat?
